# overlord-discordbot
A discord bot for sending messages from one team to another in Watch the Skies (written in Python)

For now, here's a [Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/e/2PACX-1vR423ZV1BkG0Ov0CtH6pxU4oal0VBtU4pMHF_w2RF9Cyxbp69_1ExL8B2ANEy0lbet0zikX_QMxH_Be/pub) with a list of the commands with descriptions and scopes. Eventually, I'll translate this to Markdown for here (probably after the Sac WtS game).


The skeleton of this is based off of [Habchy's](https://github.com/Habchy) [BasicBot github](https://github.com/Habchy/BasicBot). Give him some love.
